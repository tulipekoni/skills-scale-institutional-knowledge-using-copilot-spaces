## Tips for Effective Coordination

### Communication Best Practices
- **Over-communicate changes:** When scope, timeline, or requirements change, notify all affected roles immediately
- **Document decisions:** Use decision logs to capture why choices were made
- **Single source of truth:** Keep project status, plans, and artifacts in one accessible location
- **Regular sync points:** Don't wait for issues to escalate—maintain regular touchpoints

### Avoiding Common Pitfalls
- **Requirements ambiguity:** Ensure Business Analyst, Product Manager, and UX Designer align before development starts
- **Design-development disconnect:** UX Designer should be available during implementation for questions
- **Late blocker escalation:** Scrum Master and Project Manager should surface impediments early
- **Missing acceptance criteria:** Product Manager and Business Analyst must define clear criteria before sprint planning
- **Skipped code reviews:** Technical Lead must ensure code quality standards are maintained

### Accountability Reminders
- Each checklist item should have a clear owner (refer to RACI matrix)
- Track checklist completion in your project management tool
- Review checklist adherence during retrospectives
- Adapt checklist based on project size and complexity
