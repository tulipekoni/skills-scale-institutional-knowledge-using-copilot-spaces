# OctoAcme Role-Responsibility Matrix (RACI)

## Purpose
This template helps clarify who is Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed for key project activities. Use this to establish clear ownership and avoid gaps or overlaps in accountability.

## RACI Key
- **R** = Responsible: Does the work to complete the task
- **A** = Accountable: Has final authority and accountability for correct completion
- **C** = Consulted: Provides input and expertise (two-way communication)
- **I** = Informed: Kept up-to-date on progress (one-way communication)

## Guidelines
- Each task should have exactly **one A** (Accountable person)
- Multiple people can be **R** (Responsible)
- Avoid having too many **C** roles, which can slow down decisions
- Use this matrix during project kickoff and update as needed

## How to Use This Template

1. **At Project Kickoff:** Review this matrix with the full team to ensure everyone understands their roles
2. **Customize as Needed:** Adapt based on team size, project complexity, and organizational structure
3. **Document Exceptions:** Note any deviations from the standard RACI in your project charter
4. **Review Regularly:** Revisit during retrospectives if role confusion or accountability gaps emerge
5. **Update for New Phases:** Some projects may have unique phases—add rows as needed

## Tips for Success

- **Avoid Multiple A's:** If two people are accountable, neither truly is—clarify who has final say
- **Balance R and C:** Too many Responsible parties dilute ownership; too many Consulted slow decisions
- **Clear Handoffs:** When accountability shifts between phases, document the handoff process
- **Cultural Fit:** Adapt terminology if your organization uses different frameworks (DACI, RAPID, etc.)
