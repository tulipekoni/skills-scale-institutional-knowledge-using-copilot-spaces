# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome! This README provides an overview of project management processes at OctoAcme and serves as a central index to all documentation files in the `docs/` folder.

_This documentation was created in response to [GitHub Issue #2](https://github.com/tulipekoni/skills-scale-institutional-knowledge-using-copilot-spaces/issues/2)._

## How OctoAcme Runs Projects

OctoAcme manages projects using **transparent, iterative practices** designed for cross-functional teams. Our approach emphasizes **customer-first thinking**, with a focus on delivering measurable value through small, testable increments. Every project follows a structured lifecycle—from initiation through planning, execution, release, and continuous improvement—supported by clear ownership, strong communication cadences, and data-informed decision-making.

**Transparency and alignment** are at the core of our process. Each project has clearly defined success metrics, stakeholder communication plans, and risk registers that are actively maintained throughout delivery. We believe in **psychological safety** and encourage open feedback, learning from both successes and failures through regular retrospectives.

**Quality and repeatability** are ensured through standardized templates, checklists, and artifacts that guide teams at every phase. From project one-pagers to release notes, our documentation provides a consistent foundation that helps teams deliver reliably while maintaining the flexibility to adapt to changing needs.

Whether you're a new team member getting oriented or an experienced contributor looking for specific guidance, these documents provide the **knowledge central** for managing OctoAcme projects with consistent and repeatable steps.
